# wl-dark-ink color theme for Visual Studio Code

This is a personal color theme I made for Visual Studio Code.

## How it was made

[Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ) made a wonderful guide on [How to make your own VS Code theme](https://youtu.be/pGzssFNtWXw) that I followed to build my own theme. I'm a big fan of dark themes with bright colors and that's what I did for the theme I made, using colors I have on my personal website.
